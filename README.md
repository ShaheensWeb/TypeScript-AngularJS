Name: Sean Ghazazani
Repo name: Typescript/AngularJS

Purpose: Anything related to TypeScript or AngularJS. As a current full time coop student with really strong PHP, MySQL, Abyss stack knowledge I want to diversify my understanding of web technologies by mastering AngularJS, and TypeSript in preparation for my coming term as a coop student at Kinaxis in fall 2015.

Will add more specifics once I understand what I want this repo to become.
